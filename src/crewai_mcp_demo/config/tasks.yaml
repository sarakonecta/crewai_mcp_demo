analyze_github_health:
  description: >
    Analyze the GitHub repository for {technology}. 
    
    IMPORTANT: First, find the exact repository name in "owner/repo" format.
    For example: "facebook/react", "tiangolo/fastapi", "vercel/next.js"
    
    Once you have the repository name, analyze it efficiently:
    1. Use list_commits with owner, repo, and **perPage=10** (only 10 recent commits)
    2. Use list_issues with owner, repo, state="OPEN", and **perPage=10** (only 10 open issues)
    3. Use list_issues with owner, repo, state="CLOSED", and **perPage=10** (only 10 closed issues)
    
    Based on this sample, provide:
    - Summary of recent commit activity
    - Ratio of open vs closed issues (approximate)
    - Health score from 1-10
    - Brief assessment of project health
    
    Keep your analysis concise and focused on key metrics only.
