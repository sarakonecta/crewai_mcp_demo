    Analyze the GitHub repository for {technology}. 
    
    IMPORTANT: First, find the exact repository name in "owner/repo" format.
    For example: "facebook/react", "tiangolo/fastapi", "vercel/next.js"
    
    Once you have the repository name, analyze it efficiently:
    1. Use list_commits with owner, repo, and **perPage=10** (only 10 recent commits)
    2. Use list_issues with owner, repo, state="OPEN", and **perPage=10** (only 10 open issues)
    3. Use list_issues with owner, repo, state="CLOSED", and **perPage=10** (only 10 closed issues)
    
    Based on this sample, provide:
    - Summary of recent commit activity
    - Ratio of open vs closed issues (approximate)
    - Health score from 1-10
    - Brief assessment of project health
    
    Keep your analysis concise and focused on key metrics only.
  expected_output: >
    A concise GitHub health analysis (max 300 words) containing:
    - Repository name (owner/repo)
    - Recent commit activity summary
    - Issue management summary (open/closed ratio)
    - Health score (1-10) with brief justification
    - One-sentence overall assessment
