analyze_github_health:
  description: >
    Analyze the GitHub repository for {technology}. 
    
    IMPORTANT: First, identify the main/official repository in "owner/repo" format.
    For example: "facebook/react", "tiangolo/fastapi", "vercel/next.js"
    
    Then use these tools efficiently (ONE call per tool maximum):
    1. Get GitHub Repository Info - Get basic repo metrics (stars, forks, activity)
    2. List GitHub Commits - Check recent commits (last 10, to see activity)
    3. List GitHub Issues - Check open issues (max 10, to assess maintenance)
    
    STRICT LIMITS:
    - Maximum 3 tool calls total
    - Do NOT make repeated calls with different parameters
    - Use the data from these 3 calls to provide your analysis
    
    Based on this sample, provide:
    - Summary of recent commit activity (from commits)
    - Open issues count and types (from issues)
    - Health score from 1-10
    - Brief assessment of project health
    
    Keep your analysis concise and focused on key metrics only.
  expected_output: >
    A concise GitHub health analysis (max 300 words) containing:
    - Repository name (owner/repo)
    - Stars, forks, and main language
    - Recent commit activity summary
    - Open issues count and assessment
    - Health score (1-10) with brief justification
    - One-sentence overall assessment
